Scientific RPN Calculator with OLED display and ATTINY85

So far I reached my target - and the limit of the flash memory with 8156 (of 8192) bytes.

Still searching ways to optimize and speed up - to add some features and comfort.
Any idea is highly welcome.
So far I got some hints to use CORDIC or use my own double format (struct with mantissa and exponent).

Documentation is raw.
